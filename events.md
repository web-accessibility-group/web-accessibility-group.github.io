On **May 9**, we invite you to participate in [Global Accessibility Awareness Day](https://www.facebook.com/globalaccessibilityawarenessday) (GAAD). The purpose of the day is to get people talking, thinking and learning about digital accessibility and users with different disabilities.

For an hour that day, we invite you to experience digital accessibility firsthand: **turn off your computer speakers** and try accessing web-based videos; **turn off your monitor** and try accessing websites through hearing rather than sight; **unplug your mouse** and try navigating websites with only your keyboard; **remove semantic structure** and try understanding the contents of websites and web-based documents.

### Online Webinar - December 7th, 2011

The captioned webinar recording is available via the [USG iTunes channel](http://itunes.usg.edu). Select "Online Faculty Development Series 2011-2012, then you *must* select the Video tab (the default is to open a preview only unless you select the Video tab).

#### Section 508 Compliance and Online Course Content

Section 508 requires that electronic and information technology be equally accessible to persons with and without disabilities. The Board of Regents of University System of Georgia has determined that institutions under the BOR fall within the scope of Section 508. In this session online, Janet will talk about how to design Section 508-compliant online courses including: course structure, color scheme, layout, navigation, hyperlinks, backgrounds, and images. She will also discuss strategies and resources for creating accessible course content: documents, audio-narrated presentations, and multimedia files (audio/video). This information applies whether you are placing course content on a website or within your online course.

This presentation will be captioned using Collaborate's integrated Closed Captioning system, which allows for synchronized captions in both the live and recorded sessions. In addition, participants can change the caption font size as needed, relocate or resize the caption window, and save a copy of the caption transcript for future reference. We are happy to be able to provide this Closed Caption as a model of what can be accomplished.
